# Todo - Backend

<div align="justify"> The todo includes features like user registration, login, logout, profile management, and account deletion. Users can create, view, and manage todos, including marking todos as completed, viewing incomplete and completed todos, and deleting all todos. The backend uses JWT-based session management to ensure secure authentication and authorization for all user interactions. This design provides a robust structure for user and todo management in a secure and efficient manner. <div>
